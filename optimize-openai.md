To optimize costs for **GPT-4o Mini** (your sole AI expense), focus on reducing token usage while maintaining quality. Here’s a step-by-step plan with actionable strategies and estimated savings:

---

### **1. Reduce Token Consumption Per Interaction**
- **Shorten Input Context**:  
  Limit chat history sent to GPT-4o Mini. Instead of including the full conversation, send only the last 3-5 messages.  
  - **Savings**: Reduces input tokens by **20–30%**.
- **Truncate Outputs**:  
  Set `max_tokens=500` (or lower) to cap response length.  
  - **Savings**: Reduces output tokens by **30–50%**.
- **Use System Prompts**:  
  Add a directive like *"Respond concisely in under 150 words"* to enforce brevity.  
  - **Savings**: Reduces output tokens by **25%**.

**Example**:  
If originally each learner used **810k tokens/month** (as calculated earlier), these optimizations could cut usage to **~400k tokens/month** (50% reduction).

---

### **2. Cache Frequently Asked Responses**
- **Identify Common Queries**:  
  Use analytics to detect repetitive questions (e.g., SAT math formulas, essay tips).  
- **Pre-Generate Answers**:  
  Store these responses in a database and serve them without invoking GPT-4o Mini.  
  - **Savings**: Reduces token usage by **15–25%** if 20% of queries are cached.

---

### **3. Optimize Prompts for Efficiency**
- **Structured Outputs**:  
  Use JSON mode or function calling to get compact, predictable responses.  
  - Example: Ask for bullet points instead of essays.  
- **Avoid Open-Ended Questions**:  
  Guide users with buttons/menus (e.g., *"Need help with Algebra or Geometry?"*).  
  - **Savings**: Reduces input/output tokens by **10–20%**.

---

### **4. Monitor and Analyze Token Usage**
- **Track High-Cost Users**:  
  Identify learners generating excessive tokens (e.g., long essays) and guide them to use templates.  
- **Set Rate Limits**:  
  Cap daily token usage per learner (e.g., 25k tokens/day).  

---

### **5. Negotiate Enterprise Pricing**
- **Commit to Volume**:  
  OpenAI offers discounts for high-volume usage (e.g., **10–30% off** for commitments over $50k/month).  
- **Example**: A 20% discount reduces your original \$47,250/month to **\$37,800/month**.

---

### **6. Combine with a Cheaper Model for Simple Tasks**
- **Hybrid Approach**:  
  Use GPT-4o Mini for complex SAT queries and a smaller model (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo) for basic tasks like grammar checks.  
  - **Savings**: Cuts costs by **40%** for non-critical tasks.

### **Cost Estimate After Optimization**
| Strategy               | Original Cost | Optimized Cost | Savings       |
|------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Token Reduction        | \$47,250      | \$23,625       | \$23,625      |
| Caching (20% queries)  | \$23,625      | \$18,900       | \$4,725       |
| Enterprise Discount    | \$18,900      | \$15,120       | \$3,780       |
| **Total**              | **\$47,250**  | **\$15,120**   | **\$32,130**  |

### **Key Recommendations**
1. **Implement Caching ASAP**: Pre-generate answers for top 100 SAT questions.  
2. **Enforce Response Limits**: Use `max_tokens` and system prompts to control verbosity.  
3. **Hybrid Model Usage**: Offload simple tasks to GPT-3.5 Turbo if allowed.  
4. **Monitor Token Trends**: Use OpenAI’s API dashboard to track real-time usage.
